# m-a_synergies
This project simulates potential M&amp;A synergies for an example deal using Monte Carlo methods. It models revenue and cost synergies, integration costs, and correlations between variables to produce a distribution of net present values (NPV). The simulation provides probabilistic insights into expected deal outcomes.
